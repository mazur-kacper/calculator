# Calculator project

The goal of this project was to create working calculator with use of JavaScript and CSS/HTML. I think I've achieved my goal - the calculator does simple math equations and has basic function you would expect from one. Calculating in "pairs" is also possible, there's no need to click on equals button to get the result. As far as I know there are some bugs that can occur when inputting unusual button combinations but everything can be fixed by simply clicking AC button. I may return to this project in the future when I grasp on some more valuable JS knowledge :).
